/*
 * WorldController.java
 *
 * This is the most important new class in this lab.  This class serves as a combination
 * of the CollisionController and GameplayController from the previous lab.  There is not
 * much to do for collisions; Box2d takes care of all of that for us.  This controller
 * invokes Box2d and then performs any after the fact modifications to the data
 * (e.g. gameplay).
 *
 * If you study this class, and the contents of the edu.cornell.cs3152.physics.obstacles
 * package, you should be able to understand how the Physics engine works.

/**
 * Base class for a world-specific controller.
 *
 *
 * A world has its own objects, assets, and input controller.  Thus this is
 * really a mini-GameEngine in its own right.  The only thing that it does
 * not do is create a GameCanvas; that is shared with the main application.
 *
 * You will notice that asset loading is not done with static methods this time.
 * Instance asset loading makes it easier to process our game modes in a loop, which
 * is much more scalable. However, we still want the assets themselves to be static.
 * This is the purpose of our AssetState variable; it ensures that multiple instances
 * place nicely with the static assets.
